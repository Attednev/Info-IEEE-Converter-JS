\(Infinity\): To store Infinity we have to fill the exponent bits with \(1\) 's and the mantissa bits with \(0\) 's.
<br><br>

\(NaN\): To store NaN we fill the exponent bits with \(1\) 's but store the mantissa as a non \(0\) value. <br><br>

\(Denormalized\): This means that we don't have a leading \(1\) int the original mantissa which means that we have a value \(< 1\) and \(> (-1)\). For this we set the exponent to 0 and the mantissa to a non \(0\) value.
<br><br>

\(0\): For zero we set both mantissa and exponent to \(0\) .
