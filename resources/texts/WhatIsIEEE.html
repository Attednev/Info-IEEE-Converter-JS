    IEEE-754 is a Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic which means that it is a standard for the binary representation
    for floating points. It defines a specific mathematical calculation to convert a number from decimal into binary and
    vice versa.

    There are two basic formats for the IEEE-754 standard, 64-bit and 32-bit. The 64-bit format is used for double
    values, while the 32-bit format is used for floats. Due to that size difference, double values are more precise and
    can display even larger numbers that their 32-bit counterpart.
