    To convert a number from IEEE-754 standard to it's decimal counterpart we have to use different calculations on
    each of the three parts (sign, exponent and mantissa). <br>
    <b>Example with \( 0 | 1000 0000 | 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 000 \)</b> <br><br>

    <dt>Step 1: Sign-Bit</dt>
    <dd>
        Your sign bit is \( 0 \). The calculation we have to apply is \( (-1)^{sign} \). For this example this means we
        have
        \( (-1)^0 \) which is \( 1 \).
    </dd>

    <dt>Step 2: Exponent-Bits</dt>
    <dd>
        To calculate the biased exponent we have to convert the binary number to decimal first. In this example we have
        the binary value \( 1000 0000 \) which is \( 128 \) in decimal. <br>
        Now we apply the bias, which for 32-bit is \( 127 \). So we subtract \( 127 \) form \( 128 \) which results in
        \( 1 \).
    </dd>

    <dt>Step 3: Mantissa-Bits</dt>
    <dd>
        For the mantissa, we go through each bit of the mantissa and multiply either the \( 0 \) or the \( 1 \) with
        \( 2^{-E} \) and add this to the result. <br>
        Now it get interesting, as there are two options here. If the exponent is \( 0 \), E starts at \( 127 \) and add
        the index of the current bit (starting at \( 0 \) ). If the exponent is a non-zero value, we start at \( 1 \) and do
        the same, still starting at \( 0 \) . At the end - if we have a non-zero exponent - we add \( 1 \) to the result. <br>
        In your example we only have a non-zero exponent and a \( 1 \) in slot \( 2 \) which means we have a Mantissa of
        \( 2^{-(1 + 1)} + 1 \).
    </dd>

    <dt>Step 4: Calculate the result</dt>
    <dd>
        To finally get the decimal number, we multiply all your numbers together. <br>
        \( (-1)^0 \cdot 2^{128 - 127} \cdot (2^{-(1 + 1)} + 1) = \) <br>
        \( 1 * 2^1 \cdot (2^{-2} + 1) = \) <br>
        \( 2 \cdot (0.25 + 1) = \) <br>
        \( 2 \cdot 1.25 = \) <br>
        \( 2.25 \)
    </dd>
