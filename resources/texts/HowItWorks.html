The IEEE-754 stores the floating point numbers as scientific notation. To do so we split the 32 or 64 bits into
three parts, the <b>Sign-Bit</b>, the <b>Exponent-Bits</b> and the <b>Mantissa-Bits</b>. <br><br><br>


The Sign-Bit store whether the number is negative or positive. Positive numbers are stored as \(0\), negative
ones as \(1\). <br><br>

The Exponent-Bits are used to store a value that is used as exponent of the base (in IEEE-754 standardized as \(2\)
due to the binary format). The exponent in this state is "unbiased". To bias the exponent we subtract \(127\)
in 32-bit conversion and \(1023\) for 64-bit conversion. We bias the exponent to represent very small numbers
(e.g. \(E-10\)) <br><br>

The Mantissa-Bits stores a value that is later multiplied to the \(2^{exponent - bias}\) expression to receive the
actual decimal number. <br><br><br>


With this knowledge we can say, that the IEEE-754 standard stores the values in a binary scientific notation, which
means that we don't multiply a number with \(10^{something}\) but with \(2^{something}\).
